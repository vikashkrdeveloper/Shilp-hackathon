Meeting Notes (Date: 06-04-2024) 

Decisions Made: 

Technology Stack: The team has decided to utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for the development of our hackathon project. 

Hosting: We will deploy our web application using Render as our hosting service. 

Focus Area: Our project will concentrate on addressing the fundamental issues in construction projects, specifically streamlining accurate costing and project management processes. 

Progress Reports 

Accomplishments: 

Established the project’s technological foundation using the MERN stack. 

Successfully deployed the initial version of the web application on Render. 

Initiated the development of core features to simplify construction project management and costing. 

Next Steps: 

AI Integration: Our upcoming goal is to integrate artificial intelligence into the web application to enhance mapping, costing, and project management capabilities. 

Data-Driven Results: We aim to ensure that all outcomes are data-driven and applicable across various aspects of construction management. 

Long-Term Vision: 

To create a robust platform that not only addresses current challenges but also adapts to future advancements in construction technology. 

Contribution Guidelines 

Code of Conduct 

Our project is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or level of experience. We expect all contributors to: 

Be Respectful: Treat each other with respect and consideration. 

Collaborate Openly: Be open to collaboration, whether it’s on code, documentation, or issue resolution. 

Be Considerate: Remember that decisions often affect others, and consequences should be taken into account when making them. 

Be Patient and Generous: If someone has a different perspective, consider it, and offer assistance when possible. 

Contribution Process 

Getting Started: 

Fork the Repository: Start by forking the repository on GitHub to your own account. 

Clone Locally: Clone your forked repository to your local machine for development. 

Making Changes: 

Create a Branch: For each new feature or fix, create a new branch from main. 

Commit Changes: Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages. 

Stay Updated: Regularly pull the latest changes from the main branch of the original repository. 

 

Submitting Contributions 

Push to Your Fork: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub. 

Open a Pull Request: Submit a pull request to the original repository with a clear title and description. 

Code Review: Maintain an open dialogue if the project maintainers have any questions or suggestions. 

Reporting Issues: 

Use the Issue Tracker: Report issues using the GitHub issue tracker for the repository. 

Be Detailed: Include as much information as possible about the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots. 

Requesting Features: 

Open an Issue: Use the issue tracker to suggest new features. 

Discuss: Engage with the community to discuss the feature and how it fits into the project. 

 

Version Control 

Our project uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in source code during software development. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, providing tools to handle merging conflicts and maintain the integrity of the code history. 

Key Benefits of Using Git: 

Branching and Merging: Create isolated environments for new features or bug fixes and merge them back into the main codebase when ready. 

Track Changes: Keep a record of what has been changed, when, and by whom. 

Revert to Previous States: Safely undo changes by reverting files or entire projects to a previous state. 

Collaboration: Coordinate work among team members and contribute to open-source projects. 

Basic Git Commands: 

git clone [repository-url]: Make a local copy of a remote repository. 

git status: Check the status of your local repository. 

git add [file-name]: Stage changes for commit. 

git commit -m "[commit-message]": Commit your staged changes to the local repository. 

git push: Upload local branch commits to the remote repository branch. 

git pull: Fetch and merge changes from the remote server to your working directory. 

git branch: List, create, or delete branches. 

git checkout [branch-name]: Switch branches or restore working tree files. 

Workflow: 

Clone the Repository: Obtain a copy of the remote repository by cloning it to your local machine. 

Create a Branch: For each new feature or fix, create a new branch. 

Make Changes: Perform your work and commit your changes with descriptive messages. 

Pull Latest Changes: Regularly pull the latest changes from the main branch to stay updated. 

Push Changes: Push your commits to your fork or branch on the remote repository. 

Open a Pull Request: When your feature or fix is ready, open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. 

Best Practices: 

Commit often with clear and descriptive commit messages. 

Update and merge your branch frequently to minimize integration conflicts. 

Review changes before committing to ensure quality and consistency. 

By adhering to these practices, we can maintain a stable and efficient development process, ensuring that our project’s codebase is robust and reliable. 

Tools and Resources 

Our project leverages a robust stack of technologies and frameworks to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience. Below is a list of the primary tools and resources utilized: 

MongoDB: A NoSQL database designed for scalability and developer agility. 

Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side execution of JavaScript. 

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data reflects in real-time. 

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML. 

These tools form the backbone of our application, ensuring that we can handle complex functionalities with ease while maintaining high performance and scalability.
